# **What** is version control?
---


- Keeping track of changes in a systematic way.
    - having access to previous versions 
    - to know what was done

### Manual versioning

- Add a changelog.txt to each folder of your project , stating all the changes you have done with a time stamp.
- This system can allow you to know what did you change in each file

**Cons:**

- Each version of the file is a new file in your system, thereby consuming more space , a new version is generated. 
- If you are working in collaboration with others, it is practically impossible to merge changes from many people.  
- It requires a lot of discipline.
