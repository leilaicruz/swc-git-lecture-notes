# **What** is version control? 
---

## *Controlling the versions*

- Keeping track of changes in a systematic way.
    - having access to previous versions 
    - in code: to know precisely which lines where changed in the code 
    - being able to come back to any working version


---

### Manual versioning

- Add a changelog.txt to each folder of your project , stating all the changes you have done with a time stamp.
- This system can allow you to know what did you change in each file

**Cons:**

- Each version of the file is a new file in your system, thereby consuming more space , a new version is generated. 
- If you are working in collaboration with others, it is practically impossible to merge changes from many people.  
- It requires a lot of discipline.

## Git is a *distributed* version control system (VCS) that automates everything

- **git** is a version control software that keeps track of the entire history of a particular project , and also allows to many people to collaborate in the same project. 

- **git** is a tool widely used in the software development world 

- **git** prevent to generate a copy of your file for every new version you save. 

- **git** + **Github** allows you to collaborate with others in a very efficient way.

## What are we going to use?

- Terminal (Linux, Mac), Git Bash (Windows)
- Browser 
- Github account
